This is a discord version of the Werewolf Game, including roles, bot and help to explain how to play.
You can modify and copy this code as you want, but please just include the following line somewhere in your code:

Nothing will happen if you don't do so, but I really worked a lot on it, so this wouldn't be fair.
By the way (in the improbable case someone find this bot and want to invite it on his server), you can contact me at
morel.hugo.mrlh@gmail.com if you have some questions.

I'm done with it, have a nice day !
